# inference-ast

This is a prototype of an inference system, ported to Zig to get in touch with
it. Will be improving the API and eventually create a parser for it. The
original prototype is [this Haskell gist](https://gist.github.com/cg-jl/3d070aaef1110625812ac9010a09c171), without all the fancy string
interning and the allocation stuff that this program has.
